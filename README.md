# 📽️ Movie Recommendation System

A **Movie Recommendation System** built with Python that recommends similar movies based on content similarity. The application uses pre-computed similarity scores for fast and accurate recommendations and is deployed as a web app for public access.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project allows users to select a movie and instantly receive recommendations for similar movies. It demonstrates a **content-based filtering approach** using machine learning techniques to measure similarity between movies based on their metadata.

The system is optimized for performance by loading pre-trained similarity matrices instead of recomputing them every time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pickle**
- **Streamlit** 
- **Render** (for deployment)

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Movie metadata is vectorized using techniques like **TF-IDF**.
2. **Cosine similarity** is computed between all movie vectors.
3. Similarity scores are stored as a pickle file.
4. When a user selects a movie, the system:
   - Finds the closest movies based on similarity
   - Returns the top recommended results instantly
